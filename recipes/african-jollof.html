    <img src="../images/image.webp" alt="jollof-rice" width="500">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This traditional Nigerian dish brings out the best
        possible flavor of rice and chicken. Chicken is first
        sauteed on the stove top to produce a wonderful aromatic 
        base for the rice. For an extra special and authentic touch, 
        serve jollof rice with fried plantains.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>CHICKEN:</strong>
            <br>
                2 pounds chicken drumsticks

                ½ large onion, diced

                1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced

                2 cubes chicken bouillon, crushed

                2 cloves garlic, diced

                1 tablespoon curry powder, or more to taste

                1 teaspoon herbes de Provence

                freshly ground black pepper

                1 pinch cayenne pepper

                1 cup water


        </li>

        <li>
        <strong>RICE:</strong>
            <br>
                3 tablespoons vegetable oil

                ½ large onion, diced

                1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce

                1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk

                1 teaspoon herbes de Provence

                1 teaspoon salt, or to taste

                ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

                3 cups parboiled rice (such as Uncle Ben's®)

                1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, corn, peas)
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>PLANTAIN:</strong>
                <br>
                4 ripe plantains, peeled and cut diagonally into 1/2-inch slices

                ½ cup canola oil for frying
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids.
        </li>

        <li>
            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.
        </li>


        <li>
            Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with friend plantains and serve with chicken.
        </li>
    </ol>

            <h3>COOK'S NOTE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When making the rice, you can substitute plain water for the coconut milk. This is another variation of jollof rice with fewer calories.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>You can also finish cooking the chicken either on the barbecue grill, or you can fry it in oil until crispy.
